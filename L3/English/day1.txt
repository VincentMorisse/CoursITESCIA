Vincent Morisse
20 currently I'm living in Poissy 
but grew up in normandy and did a scientific baccalaur√©at in Neufchatel en bray 
little countryside town but maybe heard of it beacause there is a cheese called the neufchatel which is shaped like a heart idk maybe
in high school I took the chinesse and european class option 
thanks to that I got to travel twice in england and once in china I enjoyed a lot discovering new culture
so i'm looking forward to be able to go abroad again and I advise you do go abroad if you can it's a really good exeprience i can garantee it
with covid obviously it's complicated to do that at the moment
when i was 18 I went to live in amiens to study IT and did a DUT with the option AI and data processing and i was supposed to go abroad for my internship for 3 months
i was supposed to do it in Vietnam in a university that needed help to developt herself in the IT field but i wasn't able to go beacause of covid again
after that i wanted to start working so i choose ITESCIA to take further my study in IT and work at the same time
I now work for the french car manufacturer PSA Peugeot Citroen I study with the goal to become a data scientist
as for my hobbies i like to travel maybe your already guessed this one from my presentation, i also like to folow motorsport like the f1 championship, watch film or series on netflix prime video or disney+, play fps and mmo video games 
and do sport like going for a run or going to the gym
